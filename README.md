Overview  
Agile and Waterfall are two distinct approaches to software development. Agile follows an iterative and incremental process, allowing for flexibility and continuous feedback. In contrast, Waterfall is a linear and sequential methodology, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Agile thrives in environments where requirements change frequently, while Waterfall is best suited for projects with fixed, well-defined requirements.

Key Differences  
- Flexibility: Agile is highly adaptable to changes at any stage, whereas Waterfall has a rigid structure where changes can be costly.  
- Project Execution: Agile development is broken into small cycles (sprints), delivering working software frequently. Waterfall progresses in distinct phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.  
- Customer Involvement: Agile requires continuous customer collaboration throughout development. In Waterfall, customer involvement is primarily at the beginning (requirements phase) and the end (final delivery).  
- Delivery Model: Agile delivers small, functional increments of the software regularly. Waterfall delivers the complete product at the end of the project.  
- Risk Management: Agile identifies and resolves issues early due to iterative releases. Waterfall may only uncover major issues in later stages, making them more expensive to fix.  

Advantages and Disadvantages  
Agile advantages:  
- Adaptable to changes, ensuring a more relevant final product.  
- Delivers functional software quickly, reducing time-to-market.
